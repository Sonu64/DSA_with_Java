# 💻 Data Structures & Algorithms Journey using Java ☕ , my favorite Programming Language 💕 : The Comeback Kid's Log 🏆

## About This Repository

Welcome! This repository chronicles my journey to master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java**.

Starting DSA from scratch feels a lot like learning to walk again—challenging, often frustrating, but absolutely essential for building a strong foundation. This log is where I document my progress, solidify concepts, and practice problem-solving. It's a testament to the belief that you can always learn and rebuild, no matter how daunting the challenge.

## 🧭 Roadmap & Progress

Here's a high-level view of the topics I'm currently focusing on and what's next.

### Phase 1: Foundations (Currently here)
*  Basics, Conditionals, Loops
*  Arrays and Strings
*  Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
*  Basic Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)

### Phase 2: Intermediate
* Trees (Binary Search Trees, Heaps)
* Hashing and Hash Maps
* Advanced Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

### Phase 3: Advanced
* Graphs (Traversal, Shortest Path, MST)
* Dynamic Programming
* Backtracking

You'll find folders organized by topic, with each file containing a problem's solution, a brief explanation, and complexity analysis (Time/Space).

## 🌟 The Algorithm of Resilience: My Story

For me, this journey into DSA is more than just learning code; it's a continuation of a different kind of fight—one that involved a **small bowel (intestine) transplant**.

The most profound lesson I've taken from that experience is the **power of iteration and recovery**.

There were countless days post-transplant where the progress was non-linear. I'd take two steps forward, feel a setback, and land three steps back. The body would reject, the pain would flare, the exhaustion was absolute. In those moments, it would've been easy to give up.

**But you don't stop. You iterate.**

* **Falling down is just a temporary bug in the system.** You analyze the error (what went wrong), adjust the parameters (medication, rest, diet), and try the next iteration.
* **The intestine transplant gave me a new lease on life, a perfect example of a successful system overhaul.** My body was given a second chance, a completely new structure to work with. Now, I'm building a new structure for my career—my DSA skills.

When I face a tough DP problem or a complex graph traversal, and I hit a wall, I remember those days. **An algorithm isn't meant to be solved on the first run; it's meant to be refined through repeated, dedicated attempts.**

This repository, filled with attempts, errors, and eventual successes, is a tribute to that fight. It’s proof that **perseverance is the ultimate algorithm for success.**
